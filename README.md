PICOSMAC is a Cosmac VIP emulator for PIC18F4550.

It emulates both the RCA COSMAC CDP1802 processors as well as the CDP1861 video display 
running in realtime at emulated clock speed of 1.75 MHz producing NTSC compatible video signal.

The emulator includes the original monitor ROM and CHIP8 interpreter and some of the 
original games, but it also runs CDP1802 machine code and given the right hardware you should be able
even load old COSMAC programs from C-casette tapes!
